Heya
===========

Heya is an application that allows people to create chat rooms or join existing ones, write posts in those rooms and rate people's posts.
The home screen shows the list of rooms available in the network in proximity.
To create a new room, users, typically tutors, can press the plus button, which leads to the screen depicted on the top right of the home screen.
There, users can define the name of a new room which will follow them around.
Students located in the vicinity of the tutor will see the newly created room and will be able to access it by simply pressing the room name in the list of nearby rooms on the home screen -- no need for a password or registration. 
Inside a room they can then see the existing messages in that room and they can vote on them by pressing the thumb up or thumb down buttons.
Users can also post messages anonymously through the input field at the bottom of the screen.
